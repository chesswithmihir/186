## Relational Terminology
- Database: Set of named Relations.
- DB refers to actual data stored on disk vs DBMS is software that sits on top of that. 

How is data then being stored?
- Relations represents data being store, what is a relation is just a table!
- Relation is more of an academic term.
- Table has a schema or a description of what are the data being stored
- also has the actual data itself. The set of stuff that satisfies the schema.

## An example

| ssn: integer | first: text | last: text |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1234 | wei | jones | 
| 5678 | apurva | lee | 

Each column or attribute is one vertical slice or field. To the rigt of the column is the type of the data.

Tuple is the Row slice or Record of the table. One row would be 1234 wei jones

Cardinality is just saying what are the number of tuples in the relation, or how many rows are we talking about.

columns / attributes / fields vs rows / tuples / records

Cardinality of the above table is because there are 2 rows.

## Relational Tables
- Schema is fixed. 
- unique attribute names, atomic (aka primitive)
- Tables are NOT ordered
- they are sets or multisets (bags)
- Tables are flat, so there are no nested attributes (no recursion (hopefully lol, actually no there are B+ Trees and trees are recursive, yay))
- Tables do not prescribe how they are implemented / stored on disk, there could be multiple files for the same table
- This is called physical data independence

## Table Implementations
- How would you store this on the disk

| cname | country | no_employees | for_profit |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| GizmoWorks | USA | 20000 | True |
| Canon | Japan | 50000 | True | 
| Hitachi | Japan | 30000 | True | 
| HappyCam | Canada | 500 | False |


We can store this in row major form: <br>
Row major: as an array of objects 
```
[
    [
        GizmoWorks,
        USA,
        20000,
        True,
    ], 
    [
        Canon,
        Japan,
        50000, 
        True
    ],
    [
        Hitachi,
        Japan,
        30000,
        True
    ],
    [
        HappyCam,
        Canada,
        500,
        False 
    ]
]
```

This can be stored in a column major way: as one array per attribute which is basically taking every column of the table, making this an element, and putting all elements in an array.

## Physical Data Independence
The logical definition of the data remains even when we make changes to the actual implementation.

## Relation is not the only data model
Let's say we wanted to store our friends on Instagram. We can use a graph instead of a table. We can indeed have a table that looks like:

| Person1: text | Person2: text | is_friend: int |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Peter | John | 1 |
| John | Mary | 0 |
| Mary | Phil | 1 |
| Phil | Peter | 1 |
| ... | ... | ... |

As a relation ^^

Or you can just make a graph where Peter points to Mary, John, and Phil. Phil points to Peter and Mary. And John points to Peter.

We will learn the tradeoffs of different data models in the semester

## First Normal Form
This means that all relations or tables must be flat or in other words there is no further recursion within each entry. I believe it's impossible to have a relation within a relation.

Let's say we wanted to add each product manafactured by each company. An idea we learned in 61B is to nest another table as part of a column, but this is a big no no since its not flat and we should never have nested relatins. 

This is the principle of the first normal form. The definition says that there is no nested relations. 

Make sure to break the products into a seperate Table. Have a Company table and a Products Table. The products Table must have a column called manafactured that connects the two tables so we know which company the product was manafactured by. 

## SQL Roots

- Developed @IBM Research in the 1970s. This was known as the System R project, R stands for Relational. This means SQL was developed in San Jose in the 70s.

- At the same time, Professor Stonebreaker was working with Berkeley's Quel language and that eventually became Ingres.

- After IBM built the research prototype, this tiny company called Oracle started to build a commercial startup on top of the IBM product. IBM failed to launch its own product, and Oracle launched it as an enterprise software.

## SQL Pros and Cons
- Declarative!
Say what you want, not how to get it

- Implemented widely
with varying levels of efficiency, completelness

- Constrained
Not targeted at Turing-complete tasks

- General purpose

## SQL Language

Two sublanguages
DDL (Data Definition Language)
- Define and modify schema
DML - Data Manipulation Language
- Queries can be writen intuitively

- RDBMS responsible for efficient evaluation

## Example Database

For the next few classes we will be using relations between boats and sailors and reserves

Here are the following tables

**Sailors**:

| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Fred | 7 | 22 |
| 2 | Jim | 2 | 39 |
| 3 | Nancy | 8 | 27 |

**Boats**:

| <ins>bid</ins> | bname | color |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 101 | Nina | red |
| 102 | Pinta | blue |
| 103 | Santa Maria | red |

**Reserves**:

| <ins>sid</ins> | bid | day |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 102 | 9/12/2015 |
| 2 | 102 | 9/13/2015 |


## The SQL DDL: Sailors
Here's how we first create our relation

```
CREATE TABLE Sailors (
    sid INTEGER,
    sname CHAR(20),
    rating INTEGER,
    age FLOAT
);
```

This will help make the Sailors table viewed above.

It has 4 different attributes or 4 different columns. This is how we create the initial relation. SID is underlined and this means that it is a primary key which is an identifier that tells us the unique identifier. 

Now how do we tell the database to make this the primary key? We just write this instead

```
CREATE TABLE Sailors (
    sid INTEGER,
    sname CHAR(20),
    rating INTEGER,
    age FLOAT,
    PRIMARY KEY (sid)
);
```

Primary Key column(s)
- provides a unique "lookup key" for the relation
- cannot have any duplicate values

can be made up of >1 column. If one column is not unique enough we can add more to the primary key. For example (firstname, lastname). This helps us get very unique except when there are a bunch of John Smiths in America haha.

To make the above Boats table 
```
CREATE TABLE Boats (
    bid INTEGER,
    bname CHAR (20),
    color CHAR (10),
    PRIMARY KEY (BID)
);
```

To make the Reserves table, we want to use a PRIMARY KEY that uses all 3 columns.

```
CREATE TABLE Reserves (
    sid INTEGER,
    bid INTEGER,
    day DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (sid, bid, day)
);
```

How do we encode the fact that the sailors, that are stored in the reserves table have to come from the sailors table and not some random number? How do we ensure that the student IDs are really SIDs that are stored in another relation. The way we do this is to use something called a FOREIGN KEY to also follow the same properties of being a unique identifier, but also saying its foreign to show it belongs to another table. Use REFERENCES to connect to the other table. 

```
CREATE TABLE Reserves (
    sid INTEGER,
    bid INTEGER,
    day DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (sid, bid, day),
    FOREIGN KEY (sid) REFERENCES Sailors
);
```

I asked about this question on Ed, since IDK but I think the Foreign key must be a primary key in both tables. It's the unique identifier for another table.

## The SQL DML, writing queries

Let's say we wanted to find all 27-year-old sailors

```
SELECT *
FROM Sailors AS S
WHERE S.age = 27;
```

> Side note on DISTINCT, I think you can use this whenever you want to set(column) and show only the unique ones. DISTINCT on a primary key would return the primary key. Typically you can write COUNT(*) on a specific column unless you call COUND(DISTINCT(column)) where you want the specific unique items in a column. Hopefully we see this soon

Let's say we want to find just the names and ratings.

```
SELECT S.sname, S.rating
FROM Sailors AS S
WHERE S.age = 27;
```

## Basic Single-Table Queries

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] <column expression list> FROM <single table> [WHERE <predicate>]
```

In this simple version:
- produce all tuples in the table that satisfy the predicate
- output the expressions in the SELECT list


## Ordering

```
SELECT S.name, S.gpa, S.age * 2 AS a2
FROM  Students AS S
WHERE S.dept = 'CS'
ORDER BY S.gpa DESC, S.name ASC, a2;
```

- lexicograph ordering if strings
- ASC is default

Use LIMIT to restrict first N rows to be outputted.

```
SELECT S.name, S.gpa, S.age * 2 AS a2
FROM  Students AS S
WHERE S.dept = 'CS'
ORDER BY S.gpa DESC, S.name ASC, a2
LIMIT 3;
```

If there is no ORDER and there is no limit, since a relation is flat, it can be returned in any arbitrary order. 

## Aggregates

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] AVG(S.gpa)
FROM Students AS S
WHERE S.dept = 'CS';
```

- Before producing output, compute a summary (aka an aggregate) of some arithmetic expression.
- produces 1 row of output and 1 column
- Other aggregates include SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, etc.

## GROUP BY

Group by partitions the relation based on what you put in the group by class. First partition the students into different buckets of dept, then compute the avg gpa.

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] AVG(S.gpa), S.dept
FROM Students AS S
GROUP BY S.dept;
```

Number of results that we get depends on the number of rules that we have. 

**SQL RULE (Not PostgreSQL if you select a primary key, SQLite allows you to do this always but never trust this): We can only group columns or aggregate values that can appear in the select list.**

## HAVING

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] AVG (S.gpa), S.dept
FROM Students S
GROUB BY S.dept
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
```

- Having predicates filter groups
- optional
