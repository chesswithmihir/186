### Outline
- Single Table Queries
- Joins
- NULLs
- Composing queries together

Get hands dirty being able to write queries as quick as possible. We'll dive into details of how to make a DBMS very soon.

This is a recap from last week:

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] column
FROM table
WHERE predicate
GROUP BY column
HAVING predicate
ORDER BY column
LIMIT int
```

### Conceptual Order of Evaluation

1. FROM 
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY 
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. ORDER BY
7. LIMIT

Will omit ORDER BY and LIMIT for now since they are primarily for presentation and happen in the end.

### Multi-table queries: Joins
```
SELECT [DISTINCT] <column expression list>
FROM <table1 [AS t1], ..., tableN [AS tn]>
WHERE predicate
GROUP BY column
ORDER BY column
```

This not change the order of evaluations, because we will start with the FROM clause and we will group the tables first. We get all the data from all of these tables and then combine them together grouping them in a process called cross product or cartesian product.

### Cross (Cartesian) product

- FROM clause all pairs of tuples, concatenated. Essentially a nested for loop that covers every single pair from every single row from both tables.

**Sailors**:
| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Fred | 7 | 22 |
| 2 | Jim | 2 | 39 |
| 3 | Nancy | 8 | 27 |

<br>

**Reserves**
| <ins>sid</ins> | bid | day |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 |  102 | 9/12 |
| 2 |  102 | 9/13 |
| 1 |  101 | 10/01 |


We'd like to cover all possible combinations when performing a Cross Product of the two tables:

**Cross Product**
| <ins>sid<ins> | sname | rating | age | sid | bid | day |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Popeye | 10 | 22 | 1 | 102 | 9/12 |
| 1 | Popeye | 10 | 22 | 2 | 102 | 9/13 |
| 1 | Popeye | 10 | 22 | 1 | 101 | 10/01 |
| 2 | OliveOyl | 11 | 39 | 1 | 102 | 9/12 |
...

To get the Cross Product we must join on two tables:

```
SELECT * 
FROM Sailors, Reserves
```

THis is a concatenation of 4 columns from the Sailors table and 3 columns from Reserves. Columns should be col(a) + col(b). Rows should be row(a) * row(b) yielding every permutation. A WHERE condition can help cross out the horizontal tuples we do not want, and the SELECT clause can cross out the vertical columns we do not want.

Table Aliases and Column Name Aliases:

```
SELECT Sailors.sid, sname, bid
FROM Sailors, Reserves
WHERE Sailors.sid = Reserves.sid
```

Relation (range) variables (Sailors, Reserves) help refer to columns that are shared across relations.

We can also rename relations and use new variables ("AS" is optional in FROM) 

```
SELECT S.sid sname, bid
FROM Sailors AS S, Reserves AS R
WHERE S.sid = R.sid
```

We can also rename attributes too!
```
SELECT ... AS ...
```

### More Aliases: Self-joins
One of the biggest reasons for Aliases is because of self-joins where we use aliasing to refer to which copy of the table we are working with.

**Sailors**:
| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Fred | 7 | 22 |
| 2 | Jim | 2 | 39 |
| 3 | Nancy | 8 | 27 |

```
SELECT x.sname AS sname1, x.age AS age1, y.sname AS sname2, y.age AS age2
FROM Sailors AS x, Sailors AS y
WHERE x.age > y.age
```

- Query for pairs of sailors where one is older than the other

- Table aliases in the FROM clause
  - Needed when the same table used multiple times (self-joins)

### Arithmetic Expressions:
```
SELECT S.age, S.age - 5 AS age1, 2 * S.age AS age2
FROM Sailors AS s
WHERE S.name = "Popeye"
```

Remember that = is == in SQL

### String Comparisons
- Old School SQL

```
SELECT S.name
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.sname LIKE 'B_%'
```
This query would return any name that starts with B and has at least 2 letters.

- Standard Regular Expressions
```
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.sname ~ 'B.*'
```

. = any char and * means repeat 0 or more instances of previous. This will match Bob and McBob unlike Old school which says Bob, but not McBob. Must add ^ symbol in front to mean starts with B (regex)

### Boolean Connectives

Sid's of sailors who reserved a red OR a green boat

```
SELECT R.sid
FROM Boats B, Reserves R
WHERE R.bid = B.bid AND (B.color = 'red' OR B.color = 'green')
```

**Boats**:

| <ins>bid</ins> | bname | color |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 101 | Nina | red |
| 102 | Pinta | blue |
| 103 | Santa Maria | red |

<br>

**Reserves**
| <ins>sid</ins> | bid | day |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 |  102 | 9/12 |
| 2 |  102 | 9/13 |

SELECT R.sid
FROM Boats B, Reserves R
WHERE R.bid = B.bid
AND (B.color = 'red' OR B.color = 'green')

### Join Variants

```
SELECT column
FROM table
[INNER | NATURAL | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } OUTER] JOIN table
ON qualification_list
WHERE ...
```

INNER is default
- same thing as what we've done so far

### Inner/Natural Joins
```
SELECT s.sid, s.sname, r.bid
FROM Sailors s, Reserves r
WHERE s.sid = r.sid
AND s.age > 20;
```

```
SELECT s.sid, s.sname, r.bid
FROM Sailors S INNER JOIN Reserves r ON s.id = r.sid
WHERE s.age > 20
```

```
SELECT s.sid, s.sname, r.bid
FROM Sailors s NATURAL JOIN Reserves r
WHERE s.age > 20;
```

The bottom one is the laziest where we can naturally join and look at the columns that have the same names between the tables that are joined. In this cases, we auto append a condition said those columns have to have the same value. We got lazy by not writing the condition explicitly because Natural Join looks at the columns that are common between the two tables and combine them. All three of the above mean the same thing.

### Left Outer Join

What is an outer join? WE want it to retain all matched rows, and presere all unmatched rows from the table on the **left** of the join clause.

In the cases there are no matches, we match these with NULLs. In Java, we learened about nulls.

We'll talk about NULLs in a bit, but for now, think of it as N/A

```
SELECT s.sid, s.sname, r.bid
FROM Sailors S
LEFT OUTER JOIN Reserves R
ON S.sid = r.sid
```

Still want to show Sailors.

Returns all sailors and bid for boat in any of the reservations. If ther is no match for s.sid, then the r.bid column will be NULL.

**Sailors**:
| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Fred | 7 | 22 |
| 2 | Jim | 2 | 39 |
| 3 | Nancy | 8 | 27 |
| 4 | Bob | 5 | 19 |

<br>

**Reserves**
| <ins>sid</ins> | bid | day |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 |  102 | 9/12 |
| 2 |  102 | 9/13 |
| 1 |  101 | 10/01 |

According to the table above, when we left outer joined, Sailors onto Reserves, we combined Fred and Jim with no null values in the record, but with Nancy and Bob, we actually did get NULL records for the r.bid column.


### Right Outer Joins
Similarly, we have Right Outer Joins which operate in a similar way, however, it joins the right table on the left table. We can syntactically flip this to Left Outer Join and it will be the same thing. 

Similarly it uses NULLs for the fields with non-matching tuples

### Full Outer Joins
Returns all matched or unmatched rows from the tables on both sides of the join clause. It essentially is a set(LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN). 

```
SELECT r.sid, b.bid, b.bname
FROM Reserves r FULL OUTER JOIN Boats b
ON r.bid = b.bid
```

- Returns all boats and all information on reservation
- No match for r.bid?
    - b.bid is NULL and b.bname is NULL
- No match for b.bid?
    - r.sid is NULL

### Brief Detour: NULL Values

Values for any data type can be NULL
- indicates teh values is present but unkown or is inapplicable
- Also comes naturally from outer joins

The presence of null complicates many issues, ie
- Selection predicates (WHERE)
- Aggregation

### NULL in the WHERE clause
```
SELECT * FROM sailors
WHERE rating > 8
```

<br>

**Sailors**:
| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Fred | NULL | 22 |
| 2 | Jim | 2 | 39 |
| 3 | Nancy | 8 | 27 |
| 4 | Bob | 5 | 19 |

<br>

Notice, we have a NULL in our column, what happens when we say NULL > 8?

Should Popeye be in the output?
Not really. Can't compare NULL values.

### Null in the WHERE clause

```
SELECT * FROM sailors
WHERE rating > 8
OR rating <= 8;
```

This essentially should preserve every single sailor as the condition will be true for any integer, but really this deletes any records with a NULL rating.

### Correctly Reasoning abot NULLs

- Several ingredients:
    - We need a way to evaluate unit predicates, a way to combine them, and a way to decide whether to output
- Ingredient 1: Evaluating unit predicates
    - (x op NULL) evaluates to NULL (IDK)

### NULL in Boolean Logic

It is actually important for us to go back to our roots. Three valued logic: truth tables!

| AND | T | F | N |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **T** | T | F | N |
| **F** | F | F | F |
| **N** | N | F | N |

<br>

| OR | T | F | N |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **T** | T | T | T |
| **F** | T | F | N |
| **N** | T | N | N |

<br>

| NOT | T | F | N |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|  | F | T | N |
