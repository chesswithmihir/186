# SQL Part 1 - Basic Queries

## Lingo

Relational databases are made of tables (relations). A table has a name (ie Person) and looks like this:

| name | age | num_dogs | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ace | 20 | 4 |
| Ada | 18 | 3 |
| Ben | 7 | 2 |
| Cho | 27 | 3 |

Tables have rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). In this example, the columns or attributes are `name`, `age`, `num_dogs`.

## Querying a Table
The most fundamental SQL query looks like this:

```
SELECT <column>
FROM <tbl>
```

The `FROM` clause tells us which table you're interested in and the `SELECT` clause tells SQL which columns of that table you want to see. For example, consider a table Person(`name`, `age`, `num_dogs`) containing the data below:

| name | age | num_dogs | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ace | 20 | 4 |
| Ada | 18 | 3 |
| Ben | 7 | 2 |
| Cho | 27 | 3 |

if we execute:

```
SELECT name , num_dogs
FROM Person ;
```

We will get:


| name  | num_dogs | 
| --- | --- |
| Ace  | 4 |
| Ada  | 3 |
| Ben  | 2 |
| Cho  | 3 |
