# SQL Part 1 - Basic Queries

## Lingo

Relational databases are made of tables (relations). A table has a name (ie Person) and looks like this:

| name | age | num_dogs | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ace | 20 | 4 |
| Ada | 18 | 3 |
| Ben | 7 | 2 |
| Cho | 27 | 3 |

Tables have rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). In this example, the columns or attributes are `name`, `age`, `num_dogs`.

## Querying a Table
The most fundamental SQL query looks like this:

```
SELECT <column>
FROM <tbl>
```

The `FROM` clause tells us which table you're interested in and the `SELECT` clause tells SQL which columns of that table you want to see. For example, consider a table Person(`name`, `age`, `num_dogs`) containing the data above.

if we execute:

```
SELECT name , num_dogs
FROM Person ;
```

We will get:


| name  | num_dogs | 
| --- | --- |
| Ace  | 4 |
| Ada  | 3 |
| Ben  | 2 |
| Cho  | 3 |

Optionally, we could add a `DISTINCT` keyword to the `SELECT` statement which removes duplicate rows before output. But running this againt our query would not yield a different ouptput as all results are the same.

In SQL, however, the order of the rows, like a hashset, is nondeterministic unless the query contains an `ORDER BY`. So the above output is not the only possible output.

## Filtering out uninteresting rows

Frequently we are interested in only a subset of the data available to us. That is, even though we might have data about many peple or things, we often only want to see the data that we have about very specific people or things. This is where the `WHERE` clause comes in handy; it lets us specifiy which specific rows of our table we're interested in. Here's the syntax:

```
SELECT <columns>
FROM <tbl>
WHERE <predicate> ;
```

Let's consider our table Person(name, age, num_dogs). Suppose we want to see how many dogs each person owns -- same as before -- but this time we only care about the dog-owners who are adults. We can write:

```
SELECT name, num_dogs
FROM Person
WHERE age >= 18 ;
```

The best way to think about the ordering of this for us humans is to go in the exact order we read line by line and running the SELECT clause last. We will see later on that the database may not do this internally, but that is how we should approach understanding how this query works.

### Boolean operators

If you want to filter on more complicated predicates, use boolean operators like `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR`. For instance,

```
SELECT name, num_dogs
FROM Person
WHERE age >= 18
AND num_dogs > 3;
```

### Filtering Null Values

In SQL, there is a special value called NULL, which can be used as a value for any data type, and represents an "unknown" or "missing" value.

Bear in mind that some values in your DB may be NULL whether you like it or not, so it's good to know how SQL handles them. It pretty much boils down to the following rules:

- If you do anything with NULL, you'll just get NULL. For instance if x is NULL, then x > 3, 1 = x, and x + 4 all evaluate to NULL. Even x = NULL would evaluate to NULL. if you want to check whether x is NULL, then write x IS NULL or x IS NOT NULL instead.
- NULL is falsey meaning that `where NULL` is just like `WHERE FALSE`. The row won't get included.
- True or NULL --> True
- False or NULL --> False
- NULL --> NULL

Let's walk through this query as an example:

```
SELECT name, num_dogs
FROM Person
WHERE age <= 20
OR num_dogs = 3;
```

| name | age | num_dogs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ace	| 20 | 4 |
| Ada	| NULL | 3 |
| Ben | NULL | NULL |
| Cho | 27 | NULL |
