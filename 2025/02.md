# SQL Part 2 - Joins and Subqueries

## Cross Join

The simplest join is called cross join, which is also known as a cross product or a cartesian product. A cross join is the result of combining ever row from the left table with every column from the right table with every row from the right table. To do a cross join, simply comma separate the tables you would like to join. Here is an example:

```
SELECT *
FROM courses, enrollement;
```

If the courses table looked like this:

| num | name |
| --- | --- |
| CS 186 | DB |
| CS 188 | AI |
| CS 189 | ML |

And the enrollement table looked like this:

| c_num | students |
| --- | --- |
| CS 186 | 700 |
| CS 188 | 800 |

The result of the query would be:

| num	| name | c_num | students |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CS186	| DB | CS186 | 700 |
| CS186	| DB | CS188 | 800 | 
| CS188	| AI | CS186 | 700 | 
| CS188	| AI | CS188 | 800 | 
| CS189	| ML | CS186 | 700 |
| CS189 | ML | CS188 | 800 |

The cartesian product often contains much more information than we are actually interested in. Let's say we wanted all of the information about a course (num, name, and num of students enrolled in it).

We cannot just blindly join every row from the left table with every row from the right table. There are rows with two different courses in them! To accoint for this we need a join condition in the WHERE clause to ensure that each row is only about one class.

To get the enrollement info for a course properly we wwant to make sure that num in the courses table is equal to `c_num` in the enrollment table because they are the same thing. The correct query is:

```
SELECT *
FROM courses, enrollment
WHERE num = c_num
```

which produces
| num	| name | c_num | students |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CS186	| DB | CS186 | 700 |
| CS188	| AI | CS188 | 800 |
