# Relational Algebra

# SQL Select

Projection (π) operator picks only the columns that it wants to advance to the next operator (just like SQL SELECT). An important part to remember is that relations are sets with no duplicates. So the result of this must yield unique values.

# Projection

Projection (π) which takes in a single relation as input and selects only the columns specified. 

Selection (σ). Where clause. WHERE age = 12. σ<sub>age=12</sub>()

σ<sub>age=12</sub>(π<sub>name,age</sub>(dogs)) == π<sub>name,age</sub>(σ<sub>age=12</sub>(dogs))

The selection operator also supports compound predicates. The ∧ symbol corresponds to the
AND keyword in SQL and the ∨ symbol corresponds to the OR keyword.

# Union

Union (∪) is used to combine data from two different sets. These do not have to be disjoint sets, but the union will add these sets together.

πname(dogs) ∪ πname(cats) would combine all names from dogs and cats.

# Set Difference

Set Difference (-) is equivalent to the SQL clause EXCEPT. It returns every row in the first table except the rows
that also show up in the second table.

π<sub>name</sub>(dogs) − π<sub>name</sub>(cats). This will have no duplicates because the projection operators performs a set operations already.

# Intersection 

ntersection (∩) only keeps rows that occur in
both tables in the intersection. It is a set intersection

π<sub>name</sub>(dogs) ∩ π<sub>name</sub>(cats)

# Cross Product

Cross Product (×). The cross product operator is just like performing a Cartesian product in SQL. The output is one
tuple for every possible pair of tuples from both relations. No duplicate
elimination is needed because none will be generated. I think the result should always have rows1 * rows2 number of rows unless there are duplicates.

dogs × parks

# Joins
Joins (▷◁) 

To inner join
two tables together, write the left table on the left of the ▷◁ operator, put the join condition in the
subscript, and put the right operator on the right side. 

cats ▷◁<sub>cats.name=dogs.name</sub> dogs

If you don’t specify the join condition, it becomes a natural join

cats ▷◁ dogs

# Rename (ρ)
The rename operator essentially accomplishes the same thing as aliasing in SQL.

# Group By / Aggregation (γ)

The final relational algebra operator we will cover is the groupby / aggregation operator, which
is essentially equivalent to using the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses in SQL. 

SELECT age FROM dogs GROUP BY age HAVING COUNT( ∗ ) > 5 ;

= γ<sub>age,COUNT(∗)>5</sub>(dogs)
