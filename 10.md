# Query Optimization

## Notes on Note 10
When first discussing SQL, we went over how queries are executed. First you get all the rows in the FROM clause, then you filter out columns you don't need in the WHERE clause and so on. This was useful because it guarantees that you will ge tthe correct result for the query. But is not what databases actually do. Databases can change the order they execute the operations in order to get the best performance. Remember that in this class, we meausre performance in terms of I/Os. Query Optimization is all about finding the query plan that minimizes the number of I/Os it takes to execute the query. A query plan is just a sequence of operations that will get us the correct result for a query. We use relational algebra to express it. This is an example of a query plan:

π<sub>name, time</sub> --> σ<sub>bid = 3</sub> --> ⋈ <sub>Sailors.sid = Reserves.sid</sub> --> Sailors + Reserves.

First the query plan joins the two tables together, Sailors and Reservers. It then filters out rows based on the sid's matching and it further filters out rows with bid = 3. It then projects the only columns it wants to show. This is actually very slow and we will see a much better query plan soon.

Selectivity Estimation
An important property of query optimization is that we have no way of knowing how many I/Os a plan will cost until we execute that plan. This has two important implications. The first is that it is impossible for us to guarantee that we will find the optimal query plan - we can only hope to find a good (enough) one using heuristics and estimations. The second is that we need some way to estimate how much a query plan costs. One tool that we will use to estimate a query plan's cost is called **selectivity estimation**. The selectivity of an operator is an approximation for what percentage of pages will make it through the operator onto the operator above it. This is important because if we have an operator that greatly reduces the number of pages that advance to the next stage (like the WHERE clause), we probably want to do that as soon as possible so that the other operators hav eto work on fewer pages
